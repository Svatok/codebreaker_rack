    <h1>CODEBREAKER</h1>
    <p>Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a
      secret code created by a code-maker. The code-maker, which will be played by
      the application we're going to write, creates a secret code of four numbers
       between 1 and 6.</p>
    <p>The code-breaker then gets some number of chances to break the code. In each
      turn, the code-breaker makes a guess of four numbers. The code-maker then marks
      the guess with up to four + and - signs.</p>
    <p>A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as
      one of the numbers in the secret code and in the same position.</p>
    <p>A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as
      one of the numbers in the secret code but in a different position.</p>
